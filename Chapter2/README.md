# Chapter 2
In the following sections we will explain how Raspberry PI's pin for input/output work. We will see how Arduino pins work and how they differ both in terms of hardware and software. Then we will also see how to connect them and control them remotely.

### Lecture Material
* [Raspberry Pi GPIO](1-RPI_intro.md)
* [Arduino Introduction and GPIO](2-Arduino_intro.md)
* [Controlling Raspberry Pi and Arduino Remotely](3-RPI_to_Arduino.md)

### Supplementary Material
For more informations on the topics seen in class and to learn more we suggest you have a look a these additional tutorials:
* [Arduino or Raspberry PI?](./SupplementaryMaterial/WhyRpi-Arduino.md) to learn more about the differences between Raspberry PI and Arduino and their peculiarities, an other alternatives
* [Raspberry PI Motor HAT](./SupplementaryMaterial/RpiGPIO-MotorHat.md) to learn how to control motors on the RPi with the Motor Hat
