# Setting up your Raspberry Pi 3 Model B

### Starting Set up

* Each team should get a monitor, keyboard and mouse.
* Insert the mini SD card in the Raspberry Pi , connect the mouse and keyboard in the USB ports, and the display with provided HDMI-DVI cable. Then,  using Y-cable, power it up by plugging in the charger.
* The operative system starts. Then, click on the __terminal__ icon next to the menu to open it.
* Then you need to run some commands on it as root user to configure the Raspberry Pi (RPi). The **root user** has the permission to modify files or default settings as administrator providing the root password. The **root user** is **pi** and the default **root password** is **raspberry**. First we will make stronger the password, but first we will change some default set ups:

``` bash
$ sudo raspi-config
```
**Note:** To execute any Linux command as root user, the *sudo* command presides the Linux command.

* The terminal will show a menu which can be navigated with the arrows on your keyboard and accept options with enter.

* Then we set up the keyboard to prevent any problem when changing the password, therefore we access the option: __Internationalisation Options --> Change the Keyboard Layout__. Then we choose generic 105 key, and then UK.
* Also we have option to change the timezone from this menu.

 * To change the password, we return to the main menu and choose the second option. We have to set the new password and do not reboot the RPi yet.

*  We check that the [ssh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) for remote network communications is enabled (security shell cryptographic network protocol). We access to the __Advance Options --> SSH__.

* An optional step is to change the hostname in the same advance menu.
* Then we restart the RPi.

### Setting WiFi from Imperial College network

* You will see there is no IP assigned to our PRI, therefore to set up the WiFi we need to modify a configuration file, but first we need to back it up:

```bash
$ sudo cp /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf_backup
```

Then we will edit the *wpa_supplicant.conf*:
```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```
The default text editor installed in the RPi is _nano_. We can install also _vim_ or _vi_ to have another option of a text editor.

This file should just have the next line at the beginning:
```bash
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
```

Then we add to the content of *wpa_supplicant.conf* the lines after # IC (**the configuration is case sensitive, so make sure you do not have typos**):

```bash
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1


# IC
network={
        ssid="Imperial-WPA"
        proto=RSN
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        pairwise=CCMP
        auth_alg=OPEN
        eap=PEAP
        identity="ic\COLLEGE_USERNAME"
        password="YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```
This is the Imperial College configuration in which you have to replace "COLLEGE_USERNAME" with a valid college username, please do not store your password in plain text, but we will change it after verifying that the WiFi is working. Reboot the system if it is necessary.
**Note:** In case you are working with your team, and you do not want to show your password, just leave the field blank and follow the next steeps to encrypt your password before setting it up in the *wpa_supplicant.conf*.

**Encrypting Password**

In order to not store the password in a plain text we **encrypt** our password with an **MD4 hash generated** from the corresponding college password. You can generate the hash like this with the next Linux command:

```bash
$ echo -n 'YOUR_PASSWORD' | iconv -t utf16le | openssl md4
```
This command will display the encrypted password on your terminal like:
```bash
$ (stdin)= a6c71eedc2eacbca84003336a4a62a1c
```
Then you can copy the string that was generated in your terminal screen similar to the one of the example above: a6c71eedc2eacbca84003336a4a62a1c.

**Note:** Also you can save the hash from your password in a file and then read its content:
```bash
$ echo -n 'YOUR_PASSWORD' | iconv -t utf16le | openssl md4 > hash.txt
$ cat hash.txt
```
The *cat* command is used to read and concatenate files.

Then open the *wpa_supplicant.conf* to add the hashed password you generate:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```
In the password field replace "YOUR_PASSWORD" with the string you generated as hexadecimal characters, and we add the 'hash:'-prefix) in the similar fashion as in the example bellow:

```bash
# IC
network={
        ssid="Imperial-WPA"
        proto=RSN
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        pairwise=CCMP
        auth_alg=OPEN
        eap=PEAP
        identity="ic\COLLEGE_USERNAME"
        password=hash:a6c71eedc2eacbca84003336a4a62a1c
}
```
A last security step to do is to remove the bash history, with all the commands we had typed on the terminal. Therefore, we do it like:
```bash
$ history -w
$ history -c
```
Then we reboot again the RPi to check that the password was properly set up.

### Installing Python

To install Linux packages in our system we must use the command: ```sudo apt-get install name_of_package```. The installation could take some minutes.

**Updating operative system**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
**Installing C lib needed by Python:**
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install libffi-dev
sudo apt-get -y install libssl-dev
```
**Installing Python:**

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential python-dev python-openssl
sudo apt-get -y install python-setuptools
sudo apt-get -y remove --purge python-pip
sudo apt-get -y install python-pip
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
```
**Installing other text editor:**
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install vim
```
### Remote access to your RPi
**Weaved** services connect you easily and securely to your Pi from a mobile app, browser window and a terminal. Control remote computers using tcp hosts such as SSH. You will be able to connect to your RPi from laptop or desktop at home. The free weaved account allows for 10 registered services and 30 minute connections on up to 1 concurrent service(s).

**Installing weaved:**
Manage network devices remotely using [weaved](http://www.weaved.com/) service. To install:
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install weavedconnectd
```

**Weaved configuration:**

* To configure weaved in our RPi, first we need to open an account in [weaved](http://www.weaved.com/) website. You can register from your laptop or desktop. Once you have it, from your Rpi terminal you will execute a command to link your RPi to your weaved account:
```bash
sudo weavedinstaller
```
* Enter your Weaved account username and password. Next, you will see this menu:

<img src="Pi-installer-menu.png" alt="menu1" style="width: 300px;"/>

* Initially you wonâ€™t have any Weaved services installed, so the upper part is empty.  Enter **1** to attach Weaved to an existing TCP service (host) on your Raspberry Pi.  You should now see the following screen:

<img src="Pi-installer-menu-02.png" alt="menu2" style="width: 300px;"/>

Enter **1** for SSH.

* Next, we accept the default port (**y**).

<img src="Pi-installer-menu-03.png" alt="menu3" style="width: 300px;"/>

* The installer confirms your choice and asks you to give this connection a name (you can make it up, but remember to make a name easy for you to identify a specific RPi in case you have more than one attached to the weaved service.):

<img src="Pi-installer-menu-04.png" alt="menu4" style="width: 300px;"/>

You will now return to the main menu, where you can see your Weaved Service Connection installed, then enter **3** to exit.

<img src="Pi-installer-menu-051.png" alt="menu5" style="width: 300px;"/>

**Accessing from your laptop**

We sill see here how you can access using your laptop or any other desktop from any terminal. First, if you login to your weaved account,  you will get a list of the services linked to your devices:

<img src="weaved_connected.png" alt="weaved" style="width: 400px;"/>

In your case you will have just one item with a Type SSH as in the first line at the screen shoot above. When you click on the name of you device, your browser will open and show you a widow like:  

<img src="weaved_ssh.png" alt="weaved" style="width: 400px;"/>

Then we copy the command after *For pi username*, in this example it is: ```ssh -l pi proxy71.weaved.com -p 34644```. For you it will be different. Then, paste the command in your laptop or desktop terminal (If you are using a Mac or Linux all will work, but for windows you have to [install a SSH and Telnet client](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).),

Then, you are connected from your laptop to your RPi!! You don't need the display and mouse anymore!

**Note:** Remember you can just be connected during 30 minutes, after that time you have to connect again to your account and do the same procedure. To know more about more advance details of how connect remotely go to the [advance guide](Advance_remoteconection.md):
