# Setting up Arduino on your headless Raspberry Pi

### In case you are wondering why
RPi and Arduino are complementary platforms and one doesn't exclude the other. If you combine their capabilities you can achieve amazing results. But why?
    * The community! Arduino has a lot of materials readily available online, from libraries, to examples. If you have something in mind probabily someone has already done it and shared the documentation.
    * You might have a project that is already working on Arduino, but you might need just a bit more processing power, so the Raspberry can come to the rescue.
    * The RPi doesn't go well with 5V logic levels, it only operates with 3.3V and its pins do not accomodate 5V.
    * If you fry an Arduino you can replace the damaged microcontroller chip easily for less than Â£10. That gives you the freedom to experiment a bit more, without damaging the RPi.
    * Raspbian doesn't have real-time control capabilities.


### Installing Arduino
From the terminal of your computer connected to the RPi via ssh type:
```bash
sudo apt-get install arduino
```
It is going to ask you to agree on using additional disk space, type Y and press Enter.

### Working with the Arduino IDE
If you now connect a keyboard, mouse and screen to your RPi, you would in the menu under the "Electronics" section the Arduino IDE has been installed. If you want to work
