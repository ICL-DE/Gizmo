<p>Many products rely on the effective design and implementation of mechanisms for their function. This course builds on DE1-PMat, DE1-EA1.1 and DE1-EA1.3 and introduces deterministic approaches to selection, synthesis and analysis of mechanisms and machine elements including bearings, shafts, gears, belts, chains, fasteners, clutches, brakes, seals, electromagnetic actuators, electrical circuits and sensors. </p>

<p>Students will be challenged to design and produce functioning prototypes, demonstrating principle, for a machine that effectively integrates machine elements, sensors and actuators and software to perform a specified function.</p>
