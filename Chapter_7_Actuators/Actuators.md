# Actuators

In this section we are going to learn about actuators and how to control them .

1. [Piezo Buzzer](#piezo_buzzer)
2. [Servo Motor](#servo_motor)
3. [DC Motor](#dc_motor)
4. [Stepper Motor](#stepper_motor)


At the beginning of this session you should have collected a kit that is made of:
* Buzzer



### Piezo Buzzer
A [piezoelectric speaker](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Piezoelectric_speaker) (sometimes colloquially called a "piezo") or buzzer is a loudspeaker that uses the piezoelectric effect for generating sound. The initial mechanical motion is created by applying a voltage to a piezoelectric material, and this motion is typically converted into audible sound using diaphragms and resonators.

<small>When fixed to a metallic diaphragm and excited with an alternating voltage, the diameter of the disc varies by a small amount, this causes dishing of the diaphragm which gives a much louder sound.</small>

##### Example Circuit
From the kit you are going to need:
* Buzzer
* Jumper Wires
* Arduino
