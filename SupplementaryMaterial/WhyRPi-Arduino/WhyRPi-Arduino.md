### In case you are wondering why...

RPi and Arduino are complementary platforms and one doesn't exclude the other. If you combine their capabilities you can achieve amazing results. But why?
  * The community! Arduino has a lot of materials readily available online, from libraries, to examples. If you have something in mind probabily someone has already done it and shared the documentation.
  * You might have a project that is already working on Arduino, but you might need just a bit more processing power, so the Raspberry can come to the rescue.
  * The RPi doesn't go well with 5V logic levels, it only operates with 3.3V and its pins do not accomodate 5V.
  * If you fry an Arduino you can replace the damaged microcontroller chip easily for less than Â£10. That gives you the freedom to experiment a bit more, without damaging the RPi.
  * Raspbian operating system doesn't have real-time control capabilities, whereas a microcontroller like Arduino can handle those operations.
